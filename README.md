# Simple-Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This simple yet effective project consists of two pages – the home page and the contact page – designed to showcase my skills and provide an easy way to get in touch.

## Home

The home page serves as an introduction to who I am and what I do. It includes information about my background, skills, and a brief overview of the projects I've worked on.

## Contact

The contact page is where you can find ways to reach out to me. Feel free to get in touch via email, LinkedIn, or Twitter. I'm open to collaboration, feedback, and new opportunities!

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to explore the portfolio locally.
3. Navigate between the home and contact pages to learn more about me and connect.
